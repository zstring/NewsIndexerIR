##News Search Engine
We have build a full Information retrieval system from scratch, which include modules that parse raw data, filter data into different categories, creates indexes, executes user queries and compute relevancy score.

This project is inspired by Apache Solr architecture and is a part of UB CSE535 Information Retrieval course. We have implemented various design patterns such singletons, factory and interpretor design pattern. We also gave special considerations to efficiency in string processing and tokanization.

We have used vector space model to compute relevancy scores and working on latent semantic indexing to deal with the problem of synonymy and polesemy.
